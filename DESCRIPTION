Description: Automation of preprocessing often requires computationally costly
    preprocessing combinations. This package helps to find near-best combinations
    faster. Sub heuristics supported are random and grid restarts, taboo list,
    decreasing probability for accepting inferior solutions and location of
    previously best solution candidate is compared to. The package is intended
    to be used with package 'preprocomb' and takes its 'GridClass' object as input.
